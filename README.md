## Code Review
##### (Evelyn) Review

1. On `index.php:19` Would recommend to add a page title.
2. On `index.php:28` I would have moved the foreach loop below the `<main>` tag otherwise said tag is repeated during the loop.
3. On `functions.php` All I can say is well written functions for reusable code.
4. The design is really good on mobile, I like the way the cards look.
5. The wider screen design needs some minor adjustments. Overall really nicely done project.
